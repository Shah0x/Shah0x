# 👋 Hey there, I'm @Shah0x

I'm currently a Computer Science student who's diving deep into the world of web development — one project at a time. I'm on a mission to become a full-stack developer, and I'm especially excited about working with the **MERN stack**.

## 🚀 A Bit About Me

🎓 I'm studying CS and learning by building. Whether it’s a small UI component or a full website, I believe the best way to grow is by getting hands-on.

💻 Right now, I'm focused on:
- Understanding JavaScript better — especially functions and the DOM
- Learning the basics of React
- Exploring MongoDB and how backend systems work

🔨 I'm building:
- A personal portfolio site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Small practice projects as I explore React and Node.js

## 💡 Fun Fact

I’m the kind of person who enjoys figuring out how things work. I don’t mind making mistakes — as long as I learn something new from them.
